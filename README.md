# Assignment1

These Java files implement a simple program with a calculator, Fibonacci sequence generator, and array summation functionality.

Calculator.java:
This class provides methods for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), generating Fibonacci sequences, and calculating the sum and average of an array's elements. It uses input methods from the UserInput class.

Main.java:
The main entry point of the program. It presents a menu-driven interface to the user, allowing them to choose between the calculator, Fibonacci sequence generation, array summation, or exiting the program. The Calculator class is instantiated and used here.

UserInput.java:
This class handles user input. It provides methods to take input for arithmetic operations (two numbers), a single integer (for Fibonacci sequence length), or an array of integers (for summation). It serves as a utility for the Calculator class.

Together, these files demonstrate basic Java concepts like classes, methods, user input, and control structures.
